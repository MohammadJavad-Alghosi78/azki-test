# Register

- The registration section includes 4 inputs, each of which **has been validated**
- After entering the form, the user's information is saved in local storage, **which of course is not the right thing to do and should be avoided**, but here we did it because we couldn't send a request to the server.
- The react-hook-form library was used to handle form tasks
- Form validation is set to **onSubmit** mode
